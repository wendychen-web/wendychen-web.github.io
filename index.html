                        I am currently a Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales in UNSW Canberra. I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Adelaide in Australia in 2008. From 2012 to 2023, I was working as a Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in School of Computing at Otago University in New Zealand.  My research interests include computer networks/systems, parallel/distributed computing, artificial intelligence acceleration, photonic computing/communication, wired/wireless networking, graph theory etc. I have published extensively in leading journals and prestigious international conferences, such as IEEE Transactions on Computers, IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communication, ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, INFOCOM, IPDPS, ICPP, etc.

                        
                        <p>
                        I received a  <FONT COLOR= red>Marsden Research Grant</FONT> assessed by the Mathematical and Information Sciences panel from the Royal Society of New Zealand as the principal investigator in 2016, which is the most prestigious and competitive research fund in New Zealand (successful rate 10%). This project funding success was mentioned in the <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/marsden-minds-amazing-projects-revealed/JRJ357MTCBTGT57FAF7TJXI5DI/"> NZ News (No. 9)</a>.

<p>I am co-leading the Computer System/Network Research Group collaborated with other staff at Australian National University and Otago University. My research interests include 

<p>
<p>
AI Acceleration with Photonic Computing and Communication (AI accelerators, Optimization, Chiplet)
<p>
Resource Optimization in Computer Systems/Networks/Architectures 

<p>
Parallel and Distributed Computing (IoT, parallel model, multicore computers)
<p>
Wired/Wireless Networks (Optical Network-on-Chips, Sensor Networks, Data Center Networks)
<p>
High Performance Computing (Optical Computing/ Communication, Green/Cloud Computing)
<p>
Energy-related Research (Energy-efficient Design/Energy Modeling)
<p>
Graph Theory and its Applications (Geometric Embedding)
